These elements are required for the project/code (include all four items on your site):

jQuery Widget/Plugin - Use at least one on your site. We practiced with the tabs and accordion in class, but you aren't limited to only using one of those two. (Module 6 - More jQuery, with AJAX and Plugins)

Use Ajax/API - Include a section/area where you load some kind of content to the page, either from a third-party API or from a JSON file that you create. (The movie database activity shows loading content from an API and the cupcake page activity shows loading content from a JSON file using Postman). You could allow the users to "page" through results in this section by only loading a few products/items at a time, or you can display them all at once. It's up to you! This should include at least three pieces of content (three movies, three portfolio projects, etc. Whatever your site topic is, choose content to support that). (Module 2 - JSON, AJAX, Third-Party APIS and/or Module 6 - More jQuery with AJAX and Plugins)

Web Storage - Use web storage on your site to store/display some info for the user. This could be content you write to their web storage and then retrieve/display on page load or it could be content that you allow the user to enter into a form, then store in web storage and display to them. The web storage activity (we downloaded starter files for that, you should have them on your computer) shows how to write and retrieve/display content in web storage. (Module 3 - Web Storage, Canvas Drawing, Transformations, and Animation)

Slideshow/Carousel - Include a slideshow/carousel of images (that can also include text if you'd like) using jQuery (plugin/widget) or another JavaScript library (research and find one you like). This should have at least three images in it. (Module 5 - JS Libraries: jQuery Introduction and Module 6 - More jQuery, with AJAX and Plugins)
